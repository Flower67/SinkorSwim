# Sink or Swim

## Overview 

Our group initially wanted to do a project that took sentiment scores from news stories about the election to see if this information could be used to predict stock market performance, but we ran into challenges pulling a prolonged history of news stories for free with various APIs and being able to incorporate this into an ML model.  We ultimately changed our project to use data on Titanic passengers to predict the passengers' liklihood of survival.  We decided to run multiple ML models and compare the results of several models to determine the most effective and accurate model.
